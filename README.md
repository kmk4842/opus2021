# Translating financial lexicons to other languages via WordNet
This project aims to use well-established lexicons for textual analysis in English and extend them to other languages. It relies on interlingual links between wordnets in various languages. 
This project is part of a research project title "The evolution of corporate reporting language: textual-analysis with computer methods" at Lodz University of Technology (Politechnika Łódzka) in Łódź, Poland, financed by the National Science Centre under OPUS grant scheme no. 18: 2019/35/B/HS4/03800.
